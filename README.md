[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/libAtoms/docker-quip-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/libAtoms/docker-quip-base)

https://travis-ci.org/libAtoms/docker-quip-base.svg?branch=master

A Docker image with a scientific stack that is used for building ``QUIP``.
The image is hosted (and automatically built) on Docker hub as
[libatomsquip/quip-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/libatomsquip/quip-base/).
You probably don't want to use this image directly, instead look for
one of the QUIP images on https://hub.docker.com/u/libatomsquip/,
probably [libatomsquip/quip](https://hub.docker.com/r/libatomsquip/quip/).
or use it in your ``FROM`` line. See also:

Contents
--------

This image does not contain QUIP, but everything needed to build it
plus many tools and codes that we find useful.

Stack contains:

 - Python 2.7 image (based on Debian)
 - Build tools (gcc, gfortran)
 - OpenMP compiled version of OpenBLAS as default maths libraries
 - Numpy, SciPy, Matplotlib, ase...
 - Julia in ``/opt/julia`` with IJulia, PyCall, PyPlot, JuLIP...

Data
----

The image includes interatomic potentials in ``/opt/share/potentials``
published on http://www.libatoms.org/Home/DataRepository which has Gaussian
Approximation Potentials for:

 - Tungsten
 - Iron
 - Water
 - Amorphous carbon

Contributing
------------

To make or request changes, open a merge request or issue in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/libAtoms/docker-quip-base)

Packages should be added to where the usual istallation commands
(e.g. ``apt-get``, ``pip``, ...) are in the Dockerfile, with the exception
that Julia pacakes are listed at the beginning of the Julia section.

Small software package builds can be added at the end of the Dockerfile.
Larger software applications are included in the
[libatomsquip/quip-base-software](https://hub.docker.com/r/libatomsquip/quip-base-software/)
image in the ``Software`` subdirectory.
